This file keeps track of why files were scrapped and the reasoning behind it

server.c			socket gets opened and recieves message, but does not complete the websocket handshake. It only recieves and does not respond back correctly
client.c			This was used to test server.c initially and worked, but when using the "Websocket ServerClient.java" application, it did not work. See above.
server_scrap1		socket gets oppened but would not remain open. This apparently happens due to the basic implementation of the socket library
server_scrap2			Scrapped due to python 3.5 not natively included in MacOS Sierra
