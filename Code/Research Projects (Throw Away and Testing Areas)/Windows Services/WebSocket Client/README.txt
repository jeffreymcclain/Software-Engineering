This folder contains the code for the Windows Sevice Websocket client. The client is not perfect, and I still have to work on it since there is no error handling. I was having trouble creating a websocket server, but I will continue to read on websockets and create a Windows Service Websocket Server. 

For now, you can look at the Service2.cs, which contains the code for the websocket client service. I will show you guys a demo in class.

I DON'T RECOMMEND INSTALLING THE SERVICE JUST YET. There are some bugs that I still have to take care of, and I don't want to
be responsible for messing up your PC.
