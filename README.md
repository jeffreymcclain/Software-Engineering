My team and I developed a cross-platform parental control application. It can blacklist, whitelist, and set time limits on the websites and programs a child uses. 

I was responsible for developing the browser extension, which is published on Google Chrome and Firefox.

Chrome: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/beta-watch-parental-monit/pmjnelnhjaabpglmadebnkjhhcjonggj

Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/betawatch/

Note: The browser extension requires the desktop program and service to be installed!
